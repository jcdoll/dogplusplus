We went camping near Lake Pillsbury in Mendocino National Forest the weekend of May 8th. After we got there, we realized that there weren't any hiking trails and lots of motorized vehicles, so we mainly wandered around, napped and relaxed. Highlights include climbing a big rock, seeing a herd of tule elk, and doing absolutely nothing for hours on end.
