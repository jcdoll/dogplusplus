I just got [Unison](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/) up and running to synchronize the data between my laptop and desktop machines. It is the closest thing to magic that any software in recent memory has come for me. Keeping data in sync between multiple computers has always seemed like a huge pain, but Unison scans my home folder on each machine (> 100k files!) in about 30 seconds, lets me review any differences and then synchronizes them. If you regularly use two computers and are tired of emailing files back and forth to yourself, you should check out Unison. In particular, read [this post](http://www.stanford.edu/~pgbovine/unison_guide.htm) by Philip Guo for a well written introduction and detailed instructions (randomly, I [mentioned](http://www.guyslikedolls.com/fellowship-advice) Philip more than two years ago for another incredibly helpful post that he wrote about applying for graduate fellowships).
