The title of my last post was intended to be figurative. Yet here I am with a second printer on my desk. No instructions or a bill of materials this time around, just some photos to work backwards from and a [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/deltabot).

It's not something that I would necessarily recommend doing unless you're slightly nuts and have some spare time on the weekends. But now I have about 6x the build volume and can print 3x as fast. And Deltas just look incredibly cool - My wife calls it the Spiderbot.

It's all open source and on GitHub, with the main development [here](https://github.com/jcrocholl/kossel) and my fork, with some custom parts and modifications, [here](https://github.com/jcdoll/kossel).
