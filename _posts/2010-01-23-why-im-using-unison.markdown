Random tidbits on the computer/nerd-alert front. I accidentally launched my laptop into the air last month and shattered the screen. [It was good while it lasted](http://www.guyslikedolls.com/the-times-they-are-a-changin), and it is sitting on a shelf, waiting for me to find time to replace the screen. In the meantime I picked up an Asus UL30A-X5, which [runs Linux beautifully](http://gryniewicz.com/blogs/dang/2009/12/18/linux-on-asus-ul30a-x5/), lasts for about 10 hours on battery and is incredibly light between the 13" screen and lack of an optical drive. In order to hedge my bets and have something with a bit more speed I also built my first desktop, based loosely on [one described at Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/hardware/guides/2009/10/the-hot-rod-october-2009-edition.ars) with a few minor changes (P55A-UD3 motherboard, 5750 graphics card, 400W Corsair power supply).Â It too runs Linux and anything I can throw at it like a champ. So I use the desktop at home and the laptop at school, using Unison to keep things in sync.
