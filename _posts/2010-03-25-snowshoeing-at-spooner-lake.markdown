We were in Tahoe last weekend for my research group's yearly retreat. Downhill sports aren't an option because my wife's head is held on with super glue and duct tape, so we decided to try out snowshoeing. We surveyed the various options in the South Lake Tahoe area and decided on [Spooner Lake](http://www.spoonerlake.com/). After renting the snowshoes and the trail pass it was $30/person for the day. We hiked for 3 hours and covered about 7 miles ([GPS data here](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&t=p&msa=0&msid=101128546419637614228.000482980aa028246e4ab&ll=39.115211,-119.909034&spn=0.026771,0.055747&z=15)). We stayed on the snowshoeing trail most of the time except when finding a nice lunch spot and cutting between trails. The snow was all very nice and powdery, even on the trail, because the area looked like it was very lightly used. It was a fun snow alternative to hiking, although I couldn't see doing it very often right now because we can hike year round. If we lived somewhere where it snowed though, I would definitely get some snowshoes. Even sweeter would be snowshoeing to work.Â Here are some photos from the hike:
