Wow, I just came across [rapgenius](http://rapgenius.com/A-tribe-called-quest-check-the-rhime-lyrics). For example, you can find where The Nothing from the Neverending Story [is referenced](http://rapgenius.com/745889). Almost as good as reading about [how spiders walk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider#Locomotion) on Wikipedia.
