I had my PhD qualifying exam today. It consisted of a twenty minute presentation and about an hour and a half of oral questions / board work from a panel of four professors. It's insane how about six weeks of studying gets compressed into that little time. I passed and now get to do about the same thing with an hour long presentation in a few years. Whee!
