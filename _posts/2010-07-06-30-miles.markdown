Last Monday I walked 30 miles.

[View in EveryTrail](http://www.everytrail.com/view_trip.php?trip_id=694153)

Because I was on my own, I decided to opt for a hike through the bay area rather than in the hills so that I was both phone and car accessible if I ran into any trouble. This made the route rather flat, so it was much easier than previous hikes and I was able to keep around an 3.8 mph pace. I was still pretty drained by the end though.

I headed from our house to Stanford with a quick stop at Google for lunch with my brother. Through a lot of Google Maps tweaking I was able to keep my route mostly on the various pedestrian/biking paths in the cities - [San Tomas Aquino Creek Trail](http://rhorii.com/STACT/SanTomasTrl.html), the [SF Bay Trail](http://www.baytrail.org/maps.html), 3 pedestrian bridges, [Steven's Creek Trail](http://rhorii.com/StevensCrkTrl/StevensCrkTrl.html), 2 [Baylands](http://rhorii.com/PABaylands/PABaylands.html) [Parks](http://rhorii.com/MVShoreline/MVShoreline.html), and even a trail next to Sand Hill Road.

It was awesome. [Resolution](http://guyslikedolls.com/2009/12/31/happy-2010/) done.
