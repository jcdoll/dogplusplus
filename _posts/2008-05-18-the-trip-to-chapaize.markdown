We visited Chapaize, France for a few days in the beginning of May. We stayed with Fred-Ami, a friend of my research advisor, and had a great time touring the countryside and eating really, really well. I posted some photos and videos from the trip in the [usual place](http://picasaweb.com/jcdoll). We visited a few of the nearby towns: Taze, Cluny, Cormatin, and St. Gengoux too. Apparently a group from Taze sings at Memorial Church at Stanford once a month or so.
