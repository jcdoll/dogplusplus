I received a box of books today. My project from the last few years is a real thing. You can find it in a [few](http://www.walmart.com/ip/28821124) [places](https://www.google.com/search?q=piezoresistor+book) on the [internets](http://www.springer.com/engineering/electronics/book/978-1-4614-8516-2).

And if you're in a rush to get your daily dose of Hooge factor goodness you can even [prime](http://www.amazon.com/Piezoresistor-Design-Applications-Microsystems-Nanosystems/dp/1461485169) it. The magic of publishers.

What have I learned?
1) The [pi rule](http://strom.wordpress.com/2008/03/26/multiply-by-pi/) applies to writing books.
2) Automatically generating pretty EPS figures in Matlab saved countless hours.
3) The same goes for LaTeX. Using anything else would be insane.
4) In the end, it just takes a coffee habit and [Ratatat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratatat) on loop.
