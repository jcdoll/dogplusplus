It's official, my wife and I are moving to Switzerland! Well, not quite, but at least for a few months. I received an NSF grant to study abroad and will be working on some very cool stuff at the [Multi-Scale Robotics Lab](http://www.iris.ethz.ch/msrl/) under Brad Nelson starting in January. Maybe we'll even visit the real Matterhorn. Not bad for a first trip to Europe.
