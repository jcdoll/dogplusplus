If you've ever bought electronic components online you probably have less hair than most people. I think that digikey.com has one of the worst websites ever. I just stumbled across [Octopart](http://octopart.com) (funded by [YCombinator](http://ycombinator.com)) that solves this problem. This [search](http://octopart.com/search?q=ad622) is a thing of beauty. Hooray!
