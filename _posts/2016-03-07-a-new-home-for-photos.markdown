With the imminent demise of Picasa, I decided to move my photos over to [500px](https://500px.com/jcdoll). The sidebar link on the right has been updated.

I considered migrating back to Flickr, but decided to try a new product that seems to have a brighter future.

Existing photos, such as [veganomnom](http://veganomnom.dogplusplus.com/), will continue to live on Picasa until it explodes and I need to update links.
