Our friend Andrew performed the ceremony at our wedding. We wrote up the script together beforehand using Writely. We wanted something to the point and the ceremony lasted about 7 minutes I think. Without further ado, here's the script:

### Introduction

Minister: Dearly beloved, we are gathered here together today to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony.  We are here to celebrate their union and to honor their commitment to one another. Today, J and C proclaim their love to the world and we rejoice with them.

In marriage, we give ourselves freely and generously into the hands of the one we love, and in doing so, each of us receives the love and trust of the other as our most precious gift. But even as that gift is shared by two people who are in love, it also touches the friends and family members who in various ways support and contribute to the relationship. All of you are J's and Câ€™s community, and each of you has played some part in bringing them to this moment. This is why gathering as a community is such an important part of a wedding ceremony. J and C are now taking a new form as a married couple, and in this form, they become part of our community in a new way.

I'm proud to say that i am part of J and C's community, and have had the privilege of witnessing these two interact over the last three years. From the beginning it was evident that their relationship was somehow different than those of their peers; something about how they looked at each other, or the care and compassion that they showed for each other from the very beginning.

I recall one particular incident when the three of us were driving in a car together. It was after their second year in college and summer was just beginning. C was moving to her new apartment, and we were helping her move. I asked, why aren't you living together? It seemed like an obvious question. They both looked at each other and didn't have an answer for me. It seemed like they just hadn't thought about it. At that point, it was already obvious to me and probably many of you that they were meant for each other. And sure enough, they moved in together one year later. the following year they went to Yosemite for C's birthday and returned newly engaged. Hearing of their engagment was much the same as hearing that they had moved in together, it just seemed like it was inevitable

A vast, unknown future stretches out before you. The future, with its hopes and disappointments, its joys and its sorrows, is hidden from your eyes. But it is a great tribute to your belief in each other that you are willing to face those uncertainties together. May the pure, simple love with which you join hearts and hands today never fail, but grow deeper and surer with every year you spend together.

### The Marriage Vows

J and C, we are here to remember and rejoice with you and to recount with one another that it is love that guides us on our path, and to celebrate as you begin this journey together. It is in this spirit that you have come here to today to exchange these vows.

Minister: (To the groom) J, do you take this woman to be thy wedded wife? To have and to hold from this day forward, for better or for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish; from this day on so long as you both shall live?

Groom: I do.

Minister: (To the bride) C, do you take this man to be thy wedded husband? To have and to hold from this day forward, for better or for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish; from this day on so long as you both shall live?

Bride: I do.

### The Rings

Minister: The wedding ring is an unbroken circle symbolizing unending and everlasting love.

J, have you a token of your love for C?

(A hands J the ring)

Minister: C, have you a token of your love for J?

(M hands C the ring)

Minister: Traditionally, the passage to the status of husband and wife is marked by the exchange of rings. These rings are a symbol of the unbroken circle of love. Love freely given has no beginning and no end. Love freely given has no giver and no receiver - for each is the giver and each is the receiver. May these rings remind you always of the vows you have taken here today.

Minister: J place this ring on C's finger and repeat after me:

This ring, a gift for you, symbolizes my desire that you be my wife from this day forward.

Groom: (repeats)

Minister: C place this ring on J's finger and repeat after me:
This ring, a gift for you, symbolizes my wish that you be my husband from this day forward.

Bride: (repeats)

### Ending

Minister: J and C, you have given and pledged your promises to each other, and have declared your everlasting love by giving and receiving rings. By the authority vested in me by the State of California, I now pronounce you husband and wife.

(To the groom) You may kiss the bride.

(cheering)

Minister: Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you Mr. and Mrs. X.
