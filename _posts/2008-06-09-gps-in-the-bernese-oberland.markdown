On our last weekend in Switzerland we visited [Jungfraujoch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungfraujoch) and the [Bernese Oberland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernese_Oberland), of course taking boatloads of photos along the way. On the way back down from Jungfraujoch we stopped in Grindelwald and hiked to a glacier, which took a few hours. Along the way we used GPS to keep track of our route (which was handy when we ended up at a few dead ends) and mark the locations of all of the photos.

The photos from [Grindelwald and Jungfraujoch](https://picasaweb.google.com/100674015913182319903/Zurich) are online and here are a few of the ones that I like.

Also, the weekend before the Jungfraujoch/Grindelwald trip we visited Lucerne to see the transportation museum there. You should read about the [Lion Monument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion_Monument) that we saw there.

Wow, that was a lot of photos. There are only a few more sets that I need to put online before we're all tapped out for Switzerland, so enjoy.
