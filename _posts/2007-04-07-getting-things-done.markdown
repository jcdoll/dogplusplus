I've started playing around with [iGTD](http://bargiel.home.pl/iGTD/index.html), a nice desktop GTD app mentioned on [LifeHacker](http://www.lifehacker.com). It has a spiffy interface and integrates nicely with [Quicksilver](http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/) so I'm tempted to start using it rather than the many online apps that I've tried ([gubb](http://www.gubb.net) and [todoist](http://todoist.com) mainly). It even exports to your phone with iSync, but as luck would have it the [CU500](http://www.mobiledia.com/phones/lg/cu500.html) that I just got doesn't work with iSync. #@$!
