I just came across this comment to a New York Times [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/26/dining/vegan-food-is-in-mainstream-in-southern-california.html). It is just so well written and perfectly conveys my experiences.

<blockquote>
I've been a vegetarian for a long time. For both health and animal cruelty issues. But I don't preach; I just eat. Still, it's remarkable how vegetarianism angers folks. Really angers them. Especially the older ones. Somehow it's un-American. Many carnivores think I'm accusing them of something. Try telling people you're a vegan sometime. It's hilarious. Imagine a vegetarian running for president. A communist transexual would be elected before a vegetarian.

Speaking of which, I have explained what I eat and why so many times over the last few years that I've lost count. I never, ever bring it up but always need to be ready for the standard array of questions when I do not eat something with cheese on it.

No, I do not live in a tree with a spotted owl named Moonsparkle. Yes, I can eat mushrooms although they are not technically denizens of the plant kingdom. No, my shoes and belts are not leather due to the magic of synthetics. Yes, lions do hunt gazelle and all of that but they don't exactly have any other options. No, my cats and dogs do not eat animals and don't need to in order to be [healthy](http://www.naturalbalanceinc.com/product.aspx?ProductId=18&product=Vegetarian+Dry+Dog+Formula&ProductCategoryID=37&category=Dog+Dry+Vegetarian) [and](http://www.ecodogsandcats.com/meal-time/cat-food) [happy](http://v-dog.com/). Yes, I am physically fit with off the charts B12 and calcium levels, half the cholesterol level I had a few years ago and twenty pounds lighter. All of these, except for one, are real questions I've been asked. The vast majority of people are nice and polite, but some people just open up with a barrage of questions, usually seeking out some fallacious chink in the vegan armor.

If you're a question barrager, please take the time to read this extremely reasonable [book](http://www.amazon.com/Dominion-Power-Suffering-Animals-Mercy/dp/0312319738) written by a former Bush speechwriter or this short and sweet [video](http://www.mercyforanimals.org/farm-to-fridge.aspx) (or any other [Mercy for Animals](http://www.mercyforanimals.org/advertisements.aspx) video) and your questions will be answered. I'm happy to answer questions just to dispel the notion that vegans are the [black-bloc wing](http://www.seattleweekly.com/2007-06-27/food/veggie-thai-at-in-the-bowl-and-jhanjay-is-authentically-seattle.php/) of the vegetarians. But I never plan to run for elected office.
