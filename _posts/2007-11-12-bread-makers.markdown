After being inspired by an article on [homemade bread](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/11/04/homemade-bread-cheap-delicious-healthy-and-easier-than-you-think/) from the Simple Dollar I decided to get out a wedding present of ours that we hadn't touched yet... the bread maker. Now when we first got this as a present I just thought it was amusing, I mean, who needs one? We either buy bread from the grocery store or occasionally make some pizza dough or something ourselves.

This weekend though I discovered just how wrong I was. All you have to do is dump all the ingredients into the thing and like magic you have some incredible bread. So for about 5 minutes of work you get bread that tastes like you have been working for 3 hours (which is how long it takes the little machine) It also claims to make pizza dough and supports any sort of mix-ins you want, nuts, raisins, etc. We haven't tried those yet but I'm sure they will be good.

The moral of the story: bread makers are actually pretty cool.
(Thank you for the gift)
