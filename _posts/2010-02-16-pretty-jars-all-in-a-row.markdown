I like to store many of my pantry items in clear containers - sugar, flour, cornmeal, anything that comes in messy bags. I feel like they make my cabinets more organized, I can easily see how much of something I have left, and, I confess, I like how they look.

Unfortunately, most of the pantry storage containers out there are plastic. And a lot of the best are clear hard plastic. The kind which used to have BPA in them, and now probably contain other chemicals we don't yet know are harmful. To me, the best replacement for these containers is glass. But finding glass storage is fairly hard - most of them don't seal well and are much more expensive than plastic.

But I've now rediscovered [canning jars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason_jar)! I already use the small jars for canning pickles and jams, but I didn't realize that the jars also come in quarts and half gallons. The half gallons are perfect for white sugar and flour (I use two for a 5lb bag of flour) and the quarts also store my smaller brown and powdered sugars very nicely. The jars are only about $1-2 per piece (cheaper than any of the plastic containers I've used) and they seal very well. Because of their cheap price, I bought several wide mouth sets, so now everything is bottled up and their lids are all interchangeable. You can get them from Osh or [Ace Hardware](http://www.acehardware.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2841638). The best pantry food storage was right in front of me this whole time.
