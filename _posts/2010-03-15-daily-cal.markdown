I've picked up on minimalism lately and because of that I've been going through old papers and mementos and either scanning or trashing them. In the process I ran across that Google flyer as well as this sticker I made. The design was originally for the Daily Cal - another funny adventure.

![Recycle or I'll burn your house down](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-K3LQiqi6EY0/TwI48lkutGI/AAAAAAAAA9U/HC7EA6mqF38/s400/4435313041_3638802760_z.jpg)

The first time I went to the Daily Cal office was because of my first freshman roommate, Amelia. She liked to write and had started going to the office the first week of school. I was up for anything that first semester, so I decided to go with her after a while and see what it was like. (In high school I had been EIC and Design Editor for the yearbook, so a newspaper wasn't that foreign)

It turns out that they actually paid you to do design work, fantastical, so I took my first college job. The Daily Cal was a little crazy... it takes a lot of time and is definitely a labor of love, especially for the writers. They would work on an article for 8 hours or something and maybe get paid $10 for it.

So I got immersed in the atmosphere and during my 3 years of school was a designer (layout text/pictures in software), then design editor (same but in charge of schedule/making sure layouts are consistent), then did some production (the night job, last design tweaks and fix and major issues once everyone else is asleep) and finally was the production manager (in charge of production).

The production job was the most fun, and the most painful. You were in charge of sending all of the final layouts to the printer and making sure there weren't any software glitches. It might also involve redoing layouts if stories changed late at night and the designers had already gone home. My memory is sketchy, but I think I would typically work 3 nights a week from 6pm till around 12-2am depending on what kind of night it was.

The fun part was the thrill of not knowing what was going to happen. I also did a lot of homework because there was a ton of downtime. The pain was waiting on those nights when you wanted to go home early and always ended at 2am. I got paid by the hour, one of the few jobs like that on staff, and few people have the skills/interest needed, so it worked out nicely for me.

Anyway, the sticker came from my design days. The business manager of the Daily Cal (one of the few adults) wanted to do some recycling promos and asked me to mock some stuff up. (I made extra money on the side sometimes doing this). I've always thought most recycling stickers are extremely boring so I made a couple variations with a grunge theme. (I drew that campanile and a sather gate by hand.) I didn't even use that text! It was more mild, "Recycle because it's good for the planet" or some such boringness. It was still rejected, but Joey liked it. He came up with the slogan above, "Recycle or I'll Burn Your House Down", so I printed a few stickers just for him for Christmas.Â Such a simple ending, but it evokes a lot of memories.

Isn't it fun to reminisce?
