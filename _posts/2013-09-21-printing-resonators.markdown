I've been designing silicon resonators for the past year. So a few months ago, I sketched up stylized versions of the two I've worked most on and printed them out. Here are four of 48 MHz resonators them hot off the printer.

I showed them off at work, and the marketing/sales people liked it enough to buy me a few spools of filament to keep cranking them out.

Funny enough, the printed resonators made it into a recent article about SiTime [here](http://electronicdesign.com/analog/inside-sitimes-resonators) and [here](http://electronicdesign.com/analog/look-inside-programmable-mems-clock-chips).
