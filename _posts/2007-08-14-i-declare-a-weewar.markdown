The next time you're bored check out [Weewar.com](http://weewar.com?referrer=jcdoll). It's pretty similar to [Advance Wars: Dual Strike](http://www.gamespot.com/ds/strategy/advancewarsds/index.html) on the DS but with multiplayer which is key. Games can take days and you can have a few of them going at once. The interface isn't incredibly responsive and it was down all of today because they ran out of memory, but overall it's fun.
