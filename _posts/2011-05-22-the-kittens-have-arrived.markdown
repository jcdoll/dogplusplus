We picked up two kittens from the animal shelter last week. They were 3 and 4 weeks old when we got them, and we'll keep them until they're about 8 weeks old and ready for neutering + adoption. Oliver (shown here) had a couple of baths in the first week, but quickly learned how to clean himself to avoid the pain. Nibbler is a little camera shy but we'll post some photos of him over the next few weeks.
