I've been using [Banshee](http://banshee-project.org/) for my music listening needs the past few months after using iTunes for a very, very long time. I never got around to importing my iTunes playlist, mainly because there weren't any good solutions when I first looked into it a few months ago. This weekend I finally imported all of my iTunes info (play counts, playlists, ratings) using a great script found [here](http://contentment.org/2009/05/converting-from-itunes-to-bans.html).
