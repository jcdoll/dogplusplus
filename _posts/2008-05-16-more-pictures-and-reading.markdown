I posted [photos](https://picasaweb.google.com/100674015913182319903/Zurich) from a visit to the University of Neuchatel, a hike to Uetliberg, and the Zurich Zoo. We're in [Krakow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krak√≥w), Poland right now for my wife's work after a very long but scenic drive and the first all-nighter that we've pulled in awhile. Things that I already like here are the fire-sale prices and sweet, sweet Hungarian goulash.

You should read Oscar's hilarious story about the [Beijing Airport](http://odshine.tumblr.com/post/34972481).
