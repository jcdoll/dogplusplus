I just posted [pictures](https://picasaweb.google.com/100674015913182319903/FranceAndSwitzerland2007) from our trip to France and Switzerland in October. I had a poster at [MicroTAS](http://www.microtas2007.org/) and we got there a few days early to visit St. Malo in northwestern France which had miles of beach, really cold water and was surrounded by castle walls. In Paris we did the usual touristy stuff and managed to get by speaking about five words of French. The rugby world championships were going on while we were there and watched the quarter- and semi-finals in various bars. After the conference we hopped on a train to Zurich to visit the lab I'll be working in next year.
