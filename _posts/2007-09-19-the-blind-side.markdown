I just finished reading the best book I've read all year, [The Blind Side](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0393330478?itag=guylikdol-20). It's by Michael Lewis (author of Moneyball) and you should watch his talk at Google a few weeks ago (where I got a copy of the book. The entire story of how the book happened is interesting on its own and the story is just incredible.
