Despite the lack of activity here, I'm alive and well. I've actually been writing up a storm, something like a 650 page thesis, 200 pages of a book and two journal papers in the past six months. I also successfully defended in March, so am basically done with the PhD and just waiting for signatures on the thesis.

I also found a job, and will be starting at [SiTime](http://www.sitime.com/) later this summer doing resonator design. Hopefully all of your electronic devices will be using silicon oscillators to keep time within the next few years. Between now and then I'm going to wrap up the book and take a little bit of time off. My wife and I will be moving to a more walkable area soon and staying in the Bay Area for the foreseeable future. With the majority of the writing behind me, expect to see more photos and posts here.
