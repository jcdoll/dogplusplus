I just read a [great story](http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/1212/p13s01-stct.html) at the CSMonitor about low cost wireless repeaters developed at MIT. The guys who started the project covered Cambridge then decided to form a [Meraki](http://www.meraki.com/) around it. Those of you who live in SF may be [interested](http://sf.meraki.com/) in getting a free repeater in order to resurrect the [failed](http://www.engadget.com/2007/08/30/san-francisco-muni-wifi-project-on-death-bed/) municipal WiFi plan.
