We came across a newt while hiking a few months ago. It happens surprisingly infrequently so I took a picture to identify it later. When we got home, I realized that it was a [rough skinned newt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough-skinned_newt), which was especially cool because one of my 'sense of touch' collaborators at Stanford studied the newts in her graduate work and we'd talked about them a few times. In her graduate work, she [researched](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v434/n7034/abs/nature03444.html) a [tetrodoxin ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrodotoxin)arms race between the rough skinned newt and garter snake. Here's a [newspaper article](http://www.deseretnews.com/article/600125315/Garter-snakes-newts-in-genetic-war.html) that nicely summarizes it. What it all boils down to is that if you come across a brown newt around the Bay Area, don't lick it. Here are some [more](http://www.californiaherps.com/salamanders/pages/t.granulosa.html) photos and videos.
