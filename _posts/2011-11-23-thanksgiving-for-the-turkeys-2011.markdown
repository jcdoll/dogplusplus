We went to Orland, CA again this year for [Thanksgiving for the Turkeys](http://www.farmsanctuary.org/farm/calendar/celebrations/ca.html). Here are a few of [the photos](http://picasaweb.google.com/jcdoll/ThanksgivingForTheTurkeys2011) that I took. I also included a photo of Oliver, a calf who we met in 2010 and 2011. Oliver was [abandoned and left to starve](http://www.farmsanctuary.org/rescue/rescues/2010/oliver.html) before ending up at Farm Sanctuary because male Jerseys are worthless to farmers except for veal production. You can see how much he grew in just a year - actually being fed will do that to you.
