We have been meaning to invest in some index funds for a long time. They provide a nice return inbetween individual stocks and a regular savings account and are a really smart idea for our setup. However, I've put off buying them for so long just because I just didn't know the stock symbols for any good index funds. Thankfully along came an [article](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/2007/09/28/from-goals-to-investments-how-im-investing-for-our-dream-home/) from the simple dollar in my google reader that laid some vanguard links out very clearly for me. After that it was a piece of cake to just go and buy a handful.

This was so helpful that I thought I would spread the information along:

* Vanguard 500 ([VFINX](https://personal.vanguard.com/VGApp/hnw/funds/snapshot?FundId=0040&FundIntExt=INT); large-cap domestic)
* Vanguard Emerging Markets Index Fund ([VEIEX](https://personal.vanguard.com/VGApp/hnw/funds/snapshot?FundId=0533&FundIntExt=INT); international)
* Vanguard Mid-Cap Growth Index Fund ([VMGIX](https://personal.vanguard.com/VGApp/hnw/funds/snapshot?FundId=0832&FundIntExt=INT); mid-cap domestic)
* Vanguard Small-Cap Growth Index Fund ([VISGX](https://personal.vanguard.com/VGApp/hnw/funds/snapshot?FundId=0861&FundIntExt=INT); small-cap domestic)
* Vanguard Total International Index Fund ([VGTSX](https://personal.vanguard.com/VGApp/hnw/funds/snapshot?FundId=0113&FundIntExt=INT); international)
* Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund ([NAESX](https://personal.vanguard.com/VGApp/hnw/funds/snapshot?FundId=0048&FundIntExt=INT); small-cap domestic)
* Vanguard Mid-Cap Index Fund ([VIMSX](https://personal.vanguard.com/VGApp/hnw/funds/snapshot?FundId=0859&FundIntExt=INT); mid-cap domestic)

* Vanguard European Stock Index Fund ([VEURX](https://personal.vanguard.com/VGApp/hnw/funds/snapshot?FundId=0079&FundIntExt=INT); international)
