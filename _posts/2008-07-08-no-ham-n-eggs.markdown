I listened to a lot of [A Tribe Called Quest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Tribe_Called_Quest) back in the day and when my eyelids began to get heavy on the drive back from South Dakota it wasn't coffee that saved me but some nice hearty drumbeats from Low End Theory.Â Anyways, ten years later and avoiding meat as much as possible, I have new appreciation for Ham 'n' Eggs.
