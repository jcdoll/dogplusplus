Cassie, Nick and I went kayaking down near Monterey one foggy Sunday. There was a large fire near Santa Cruz at the time, so the air was hazy and smelled of smoke. Besides that it was a lot of fun and we saw lots of sea otters, sea lions and seals. The way [the trip works](http://www.montereybaykayaks.com/info/moss_landing.php) is that you start in the harbor and then head inland for about 5 miles before turning around. Low tide occurred about halfway through our trip, we had to fight the current on way back towards the harbor. We were on the water for about 4 hours and although I wouldn't do the same area again, it was a lot of fun. I would definitely bring a camera with a longer zoom next time though to get better photos.

Here are a few photos. The sun came out for a few minutes here and there but it was smokey and grey for the most part.
