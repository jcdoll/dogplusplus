I've posted some of the pictures from [Krakow](http://picasaweb.com/jcdoll). Here are a couple of my favorites. I used to only be able to do HDR on my 350D, but since putting [CHDK](http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page) on my compact camera I've been able to do exposure bracketing and have been playing with HDR quite a bit. I've also been doing a better job at adding the GPS coordinates (using [Google Earth and Geotagger](http://craig.stanton.net.nz/software/Geotagger.html)), so you can see where they were taken on a map.
