I went outside early on Monday morning and realized that we have a large bee nest in our orange tree! I only saw the nest because the bees were extremely active - flying from our flowers to the hive over and over again.

We usually don't get outside until the afternoon and they seem to get sleepier, so you can't tell they are there unless you know where to look. This morning it was raining, and that also seems to keep the activity fairly low.

I find bees fascinating. And I love them because they pollinate my vegetables. They've been doing an excellent job with the fava beans and the newly planted tomatoes. Lola chases them. This is very destructive, but it's funny to watch her spinning around in circles after a seemingly invisible foe.

Everybody is peacefully coexisting, so there is very little chance that we'll remove the nest - which means we get to watch the bees all year long!
